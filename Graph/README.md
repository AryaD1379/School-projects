#  CIS 22C project 
## _Graph_
In this assignment we write our own Graph ADT. This project doesn't contain any interface. The purpose of this assignment is to learn to create our own Graph class without using any library. The Graph.java contains constructors, destructors, accessors, Manipulation procedures and additional operations such as printing the graph. The file also contains a singly_linked list which the Graph.java will be using to store its data.
